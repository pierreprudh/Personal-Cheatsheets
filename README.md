# CheatSheet - Pierreprudh

A collection of cheatsheets, notes, notebooks and scripts covering topics in Data Science, Machine Learning, Python and Mathematics.

This repository serves as a personal knowledge base, helping me refresh key concepts and quickly refer to essential formulas, code snippets, and methodologies.

All materials are hand-written by me, so some errors or approximations may exist. This project is meant to evolve continuously as I learn, revisit topics, or deepen my understanding.


## Project Goals

Consolidate essential knowledge in DS/ML/Python

Provide fast reference material (cheatsheets, Markdown, notebooks, .py utilities)

Build a clean and structured GitHub project

Track learning progress over time
