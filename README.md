# CheatSheet - Pierreprudh

A collection of cheatsheets, notes, notebooks and scripts covering topics in Data Science, Machine Learning, Python and Mathematics.

This repository serves as a personal knowledge base, helping me refresh key concepts and quickly refer to essential formulas, code snippets, and methodologies.

All materials are hand-written by me, so some errors or approximations may exist. This project is meant to evolve continuously as I learn, revisit topics, or deepen my understanding.


## Project Goals

Consolidate essential knowledge in DS/ML/Python

Provide fast reference material (cheatsheets, Markdown, notebooks, .py utilities)

Build a clean and structured GitHub project

Track learning progress over time

## Virtual Environment 

To ensure reproducibility : 

```python 
# Create environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate
source .venv/bin/activate      # macOS/Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For Windows powershell :

```bash 
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```
